Hypothesis:
- Age vs owned => Teen games pref
- Age vs # votes => Teen games have the most # of votes
- As the weight goes up, so does avg time, makes sense, more complex.
- As weight goes up, so does the avg rating, does this mean more complex = better?

Looking at owners_v_rating we can see that there are more owners where the avg rating is high (7.0 to 8.25 have the highest num votes).
This makes sense since people will probably buy the higher rated games.

This being said, we have an issue with this. Here is a problem. Doesn't matter how many owners a game has, what if
only 1 person rated that game a perfect 10. That would make the avg rating a 10, but doesn't really encapsulate everyone.

Because of the problem above, we have to make it so there is a threshhold: if there are num_votes > 5000 set to 1 else set to 0.
This can be seen in the num_votes_v_rating. The best game will be the one that has the highest avg_rating & that belongs to the
subset where num_votes > 5000 (the orange datapoints in the plot).

Previously mentioned that as weight goes up, so does tje avg_rating, but as we can see in weight_v_rating_5000, where the orange
dots are games that have more than 5000 reviews. As can be seen, not a lot have above 5000 reviews.
We can also look at weight_v_rating_1000, where the threshold is 1000, and still we can confirm this hypothesis.
